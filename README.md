# 🚀 Redgifs Downloader Button  

### The button Redgifs forgot to add.  

### ❌ Rejected by Chrome. ❌ Rejected by Firefox.  
### ✅ Approved by Me.  

I tried to do things the *proper* way. I really did. Submitted this extension to the **Chrome Web Store** and the **Firefox Add-ons Store**, thinking,  
*"Hey, this is a simple, useful tool—what could go wrong?"*  

Well… **both rejected it.** 🎉  

So I said **"F**k it"** and uploaded it here.  

No weird websites. No sketchy extensions. Just a **clean, fast, and easy** way to download Redgifs videos **in HD, with audio, instantly**.

## 🛠️ Installation  

### 🟢 Chrome / Edge / Brave (or any Chromium-based browser)  
Since the **Chrome Web Store rejected it**, you'll need to install it manually:  

1. **Download the ZIP** file from the latest release, under the tag "chrome".  
2. **Unzip it** anywhere on your PC.  
3. Open **Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`.  
4. Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle in the top right corner).  
5. Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the unzipped folder.  

Done! Now just head to Redgifs and enjoy your **new Download button**.

### 🟠 Firefox  
Mozilla didn’t want it either, so here’s how to install it yourself:  

#### **Temporary Installation (for testing)**  
1. **Download the ZIP** file from the latest release, under the tag "firefox".  
2. **Unzip it** anywhere on your PC.  
3. Open **Firefox** and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.  
4. Click **"Load Temporary Add-on"** and select the `manifest.json` file inside the unzipped folder.  

⚠️ **This only lasts until you restart Firefox.**  


#### **Permanent Installation (Self-Signing)**  
Want it to stick around? You’ll need to **self-sign** the extension(not tested):  
=======
### 🔥 Permanent Installation (Without Signing)  
Some versions of Firefox **allow installing unsigned extensions permanently**:  


- **Firefox Developer Edition**  
- **Firefox Nightly**  
- **Firefox ESR (Enterprise Edition)**  
- **Unbranded Firefox Builds**  

If you're using one of these versions, you can **disable extension signing** and install it like a normal add-on:  

1. Open Firefox and go to `about:config`.  
2. Search for `xpinstall.signatures.required`.  
3. **Set it to `false`** to allow unsigned add-ons.  
4. Now go to `about:addons` and click **"Install Add-on From File"**, then select the `.xpi` file from the extracted folder.  

✅ **Now you have a permanently installed extension without signing!**  

For more details, check Mozilla’s official documentation:
