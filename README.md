# 🚀 Redgifs Button Downloader 

### The button Redgifs forgot to add.  

### ❌ Rejected by Chrome. ❌ Rejected by Firefox.  
### ✅ Approved by Me.  

I tried to do things the *proper* way. I really did. Submitted this extension to the **Chrome Web Store** and the **Firefox Add-ons Store**, thinking,  
*"Hey, this is a simple, useful tool—what could go wrong?"*  

Well… **both rejected it.** 🎉  

So I said **"F**k it"** and uploaded it here.  

No weird websites. No sketchy extensions. Just a **clean, fast, and easy** way to download Redgifs videos **in HD, with audio, instantly**.

## 🛠️ Installation  

### 🟢 Chrome / Edge / Brave (or any Chromium-based browser)  
Since the **Chrome Web Store rejected it**, you'll need to install it manually:  

1. **Download the ZIP** file from the latest release, under the tag "chrome".  
2. **Unzip it** anywhere on your PC.  
3. Open **Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`.  
4. Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle in the top right corner).  
5. Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the unzipped folder.  

Done! Now just head to Redgifs and enjoy your **new Download button**.

### 🟠 Firefox  
Mozilla didn’t want it either, so here’s how to install it yourself:  

#### **Temporary Installation (for testing)**  
1. **Download the ZIP** file from the latest release, under the tag "firefox".  
2. **Unzip it** anywhere on your PC.  
3. Open **Firefox** and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.  
4. Click **"Load Temporary Add-on"** and select the `manifest.json` file inside the unzipped folder.  

⚠️ **This only lasts until you restart Firefox.**  

#### **Permanent Installation (Self-Signing)**  
Want it to stick around? You’ll need to **self-sign** the extension (not tested):  

1. **Create a Firefox Add-ons (AMO) account** [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/).  
2. **Zip your extension files** (not the folder, just the contents).  
3. **Submit it for self-signing** [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/submit/distribution).  
4. **Download the signed `.xpi` file** and install it via `about:addons`.
